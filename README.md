# P-Bot
P-Bot Basic 
This is the first firmware for P-Bot.
It is a mess and far from perfect. But it works as a basic firmware.
Feel free to use it. 

For non coders, I have added the bin file from the arduino code. You can just use ESP web based flash tool to flash the P-Bot. If there is another version of firmware, I will just upload the bin file. Download the bin file.
Open the link below, select your serial port and change the address from 0x1000 to 0x10000, and choose the downloaded bin file from your computer. Then, hit program. After finish, hit disconnect, pull out the usb wire and reenter the usb wire into the usb port. It should boot to the new firmware.
